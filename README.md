# DAG Analysis and Random Model Generation

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) data, primarily focusing on non-running time DAGs obtained from Mobileye datasets. The main steps of the project are:

1. **Analyzing DAG's Data **
2. **Generating Random Models of DAGs**
3. **Simulating DAGs and Comparing with Heuristics**

## 1. Analyzing DAG's Data 

In this phase, we will parse and analyze DAG data extracted from Mobileye datasets. The objectives include:

- Developing parsers to extract DAG structures, node dependencies, and other relevant information.
- Calculating metrics such as in-degree, out-degree, critical paths, and width of the DAGs.
- Visualizing DAG properties for better understanding and analysis.

## 2. Generating Random Models of DAGs

The next step involves creating a system to generate random models of DAGs. This includes:

- Designing algorithms to randomly generate DAG structures based on specified parameters.
- Incorporating randomness in node dependencies, task durations, and other factors to simulate real-world variability.
- Generating a range of random DAG models for testing and comparison purposes.

## 3. Simulating DAGs and Comparing with Heuristics

In the final phase, we will simulate the generated DAG models and compare them with known heuristics of random model generators. This includes:

- Implementing simulation algorithms to execute tasks within the DAGs based on dependencies and durations.
- Collecting simulation data such as execution times, critical paths, and overall performance metrics.
- Analyzing simulation results and comparing them with expected outcomes from random model generators.
